# Hello, I'm lisongyao
I am learning Git and GitHub.

Self-introduction

Hello everyone, my name is Li Songyao, I fome China. I am a sophomore student majoring in Computer Science. I once studied C++ and learned some basic concepts, but I am not very familiar with Java. I do not have much software development experience yet, but I am eager to improve and will work hard to learn. I am very excited to join team activities, because I believe teamwork can help me grow and solve problems together. I look forward to learning from all of you and contributing to our group.

Discussion â€” Software Development experiences & related knowledge

To be honest, I do not have much software development experience so far. I only learned some basic programming skills through C++, and I am still a beginner in many areas. However, I am very motivated to study hard, especially in Java and new technologies. I believe that through this course and team collaboration, I will gain more knowledge and practical experience. I hope to contribute my effort to the group and improve together with my teammates.
